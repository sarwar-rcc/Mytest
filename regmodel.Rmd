## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
##Data frame
```{r alligator}
alligator = data.frame(
  lnLength = c(3.87, 3.61, 4.33, 3.43, 3.81, 3.83, 3.46, 3.76,
    3.50, 3.58, 4.19, 3.78, 3.71, 3.73, 3.78),
  lnWeight = c(4.87, 3.93, 6.46, 3.33, 4.38, 4.70, 3.50, 4.50,
    3.58, 3.64, 5.90, 4.43, 4.38, 4.42, 4.25)
)
```

```{r alligator1}
summary(alligator)
```

## Including Plots
```{r test, echo=FALSE}

library(lattice)
#table(alligator$lnLength, alligator$lnWeight)
xyplot(lnWeight ~ lnLength, data = alligator,
  xlab = "Snout vent length (inches) on log scale",
  ylab = "Weight (pounds) on log scale",
  main = "Alligators in Central Florida"
)
```

```{r linear model}
alli.mod1 = lm(lnWeight ~ lnLength, data = alligator)
summary(alli.mod1)
```

```{r residual, echo=FALSE}

xyplot(resid(alli.mod1) ~ fitted(alli.mod1),
  xlab = "Fitted Values",
  ylab = "Residuals",
  main = "Residual Diagnostic Plot",
  panel = function(x, y, ...)
  {
    panel.grid(h = -1, v = -1)
    panel.abline(h = 0)
    panel.xyplot(x, y, ...)
  }
)
```

```{r quantile}
qqmath( ~ resid(alli.mod1),
  xlab = "Theoretical Quantiles",
  ylab = "Residuals"
)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
